NAME
    Net::IP::Minimal - Minimal functions from Net::IP

VERSION
    version 0.06

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::IP::Minimal qw[:PROC];

      my $ip = '172.16.0.216';

      ip_is_ipv4( $ip ) and print "$ip is IPv4";

      $ip = 'dead:beef:89ab:cdef:0123:4567:89ab:cdef';

      ip_is_ipv6( $ip ) and print "$ip is IPv6";

      print ip_get_version( $ip );

DESCRIPTION
    Net::IP is very feature complete, but I found I was only using three of
    its functions and it uses quite a bit of memory
    <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=24525>.

    This module only provides the minimal number of functions that I use in
    my modules.

FUNCTIONS
    The same as Net::IP these functions are not exported by default. You may
    import them explicitly or use ":PROC" to import them all.

    "ip_get_version"
        Try to guess the IP version of an IP address.

            Params  : IP address
            Returns : 4, 6, undef(unable to determine)

        "$version = ip_get_version ($ip)"

    "ip_is_ipv4"
        Check if an IP address is of type 4.

            Params  : IP address
            Returns : 1 (yes) or 0 (no)

        "ip_is_ipv4($ip) and print "$ip is IPv4";"

    "ip_is_ipv6"
        Check if an IP address is of type 6.

            Params            : IP address
            Returns           : 1 (yes) or 0 (no)

        "ip_is_ipv6($ip) and print "$ip is IPv6";"
